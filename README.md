# Imitation Mario
The goal of this project is to use imitation learning alongside gym-super-mario-bros to create an agent to beat the classic supermariobros v3.  

## Usage
1. Set up your environment from the environment.yaml file.
2. Run main.py and play the game: 'w' and 'd' to move, 'o' to jump.
3. Recordings are automatically saved locally in the recordings folder.
