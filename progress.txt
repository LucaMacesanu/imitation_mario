Data Cleaning:
! processing action space
! seperating out second stage recordings
! Seperating recordings into "runs" (split by death and wins)
! Rejecting low quality runs
! fixing action space

Data Exploration:
- visualizing replays
- custom data collection*
- score/time
! histograms of stats for all data collected
! average loss between close states

Feature Engineering:
! merging output classes

Modelling:
- replay agent
! do cross evaluation
! mlp
! cnn
! knn
! rrt
! 
! random disturbances to check how the policy works in out of distribution scenarios
! behavior cloning
